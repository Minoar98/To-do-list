# To-Do-App

![To Do App](photo/image-1.png)

I developed a [To Do App](https://vanila-js-to-do-application.netlify.app/) using Vanilla JavaScript (ES6), HTML5, CSS3, and DOM manipulation, with data persistence handled via the Web Storage API (localStorage). Although there is no backend, the app mimics a full REST-like experience with complete CRUD functionality, custom validation, and real-time feedback via alert notifications.

## üîß Tech Used:

JavaScript (ES6+) ‚Äì For logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation.

HTML5 & CSS3 ‚Äì For responsive and clean UI design.

Web Storage API ‚Äì For persistent local data storage (no server required).

## Features

üì• GET (Read) Features
Users can fetch and view all existing todo tasks from `localStorage`.

If no tasks are found, an empty list view is displayed.

Validation:

Input must not be empty.

Task length must be `‚â§ 40` characters, else an info alert is shown.

On successful submission:

The task is stored in localStorage and shown in the pending task.

After clicking the checkbox, a pending task should be transferred to a completed task.

‚úèÔ∏è PUT (Update) Features
Users can edit existing pending tasks by clicking edit (‚úèÔ∏è) icon and through an edit input field.

Task length must be `‚â§ 40` characters, else an info alert is shown.

After a successful update:

The updated task is visually highlighted with bold text.

üóëÔ∏è DELETE (Remove) Features
Users can delete any todo task from the completed task by clicking delete (üóëÔ∏è) icon.

After successful deletion:

The task is removed from localStorage as well.

## Deployment

I have deployed my project on the Netlify website. Visit & investigate the application using the following hosted link.

## Lessons Learned

- Using flags like isEditing to switch behavior

- Validating user input before performing actions

- UI dynamically using JavaScript

- Importance of saving app state to localStorage

## Challenges

- Challenges of Using One Button for Add and Edit

- **Managing Button State and Text:**
  The button must clearly indicate whether it‚Äôs in ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù or ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù mode by dynamically changing its label and behavior, to avoid confusing the user.

- Preventing Multiple Concurrent Edits:\*\*
  The app should restrict users from editing more than one task at a time to maintain data integrity and prevent conflicting changes.

- **Handling User Actions Smoothly:**
  Providing intuitive features like inline editing, cancel options, and input focus is necessary to create a seamless experience and avoid frustration during task updates.
